## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive sales dashboard for McDonaldâ€™s in South America for the year 2022. It visualizes critical business metrics including total sales, profit, number of customers, and customer satisfaction ratings. The dashboard also offers a breakdown of sales by country and tracks monthly sales trends compared between 2021 and 2022.


### Data Source

- Primary Data: The sales and customer data were obtained from internal McDonald's sales databases or similar simulated datasets reflecting the South American region's performance.
- Period Covered: 2021 and 2022.
- Metrics Included:
  - Sales (in millions of USD)
  - Profit (in millions of USD)
  - Customer Volume
  - Customer Satisfaction (Quality, Service, Hygiene, Availability, Speed)


### Tools

- Data Visualization: Microsoft Excel (for creating charts, graphs, and dashboard layout)
- Data Processing: Excel functions and basic data cleaning procedures
  
  
### Data Cleaning Preparation

The dataset required minimal cleaning as it was directly imported from internal systems. Steps included:
- Data Validation: Ensuring accuracy in sales, profit, and customer counts.
- Outlier Detection: Identifying any anomalies in customer satisfaction scores.
- Data Formatting: Formatting values for consistency (e.g., USD, percentages).


### Explanatory Data Analysis

EDA was performed to understand trends, identify patterns, and highlight key areas of interest:
1. **Yearly Trend Comparison**: Sales trends between 2021 and 2022 were plotted to observe growth or decline across months.
2. **Country-Level Performance**: A donut chart was created to display sales distribution by country.
3. **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**: A radar chart shows key satisfaction metrics, giving insights into customer experience areas.



### Data Analysis

- **Sales Analysis**: Compared sales figures month-over-month and year-over-year to pinpoint peak performance periods.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Customer volume metrics were used to gauge market size and reach across different regions.
- **Profitability Check**: Profit figures were correlated with sales and customer data to understand revenue drivers.



### Result and Findings

1. **Sales Growth**: Notable increase in sales from Q3 to Q4, 2022.
2. **High-Performing Countries**: Argentina and Brazil were the top-performing countries by sales volume.
3. **Customer Satisfaction Insights**: The radar chart reveals high scores in quality and hygiene but potential improvement areas in service speed.


### Recommendations

- **Invest in Fast Service Improvements**: Enhance service speed to boost customer satisfaction, as it scored lowest.
- **Focus on High-Performing Countries**: Target Argentina and Brazil with marketing efforts, as they contribute significantly to total sales.
- **Monitor Q3 Trends**: Address factors causing drops in sales around Q2 to Q3 each year.


### Limitations

- **Data Limitations**: The dashboard relies on historical data without seasonal adjustments.
- **Regional Focus**: This analysis applies only to South America and may not reflect trends in other regions.
- **Granularity**: Some data points (e.g., daily sales, detailed customer demographics) are not available, limiting deeper analysis.
